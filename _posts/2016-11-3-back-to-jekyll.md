I tried using [Ghost][0] for a while and it worked out very nice.  It had
support for Markdown and looked okay on most the screens I was using. So I
can't say why I stopped writing on blog.alemayhu.com and decided to delete it.

I guess I still want to improve my writing.  I have some writing cooking, all
of them are focused around kernel hacking.  I am taking my time, so they won't
be posted here before a while.

To who ever is reading this, happy hacking :)
