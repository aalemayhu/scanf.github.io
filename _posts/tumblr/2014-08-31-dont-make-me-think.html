<p>Note: This is not an extensive review of the book, it is more like a personal review to practice writing English :)</p>
<p>The full title of the book I read is <strong><em>Donâ€™t Make Me Think, Revisited: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability (3rd Edition) (Voices That Matter) [Kindle Edition]</em></strong>. The title is just too long. After completing the book I tried sharing it from my Kindle, but could not do it. The Kindle has a limitation on the number of characters allowed in a message.</p>
<p>I decided to read the book for work. I mostly make applications for Android and iOS, but I am currently learning Angularjs and will proably be doing more web development in the future. In the company I work in everyone partakes in the designing and testing of our products. This book seemed interesting for me because I had read so many good reviews and one of my collegaues had also recommended it.</p>
<p>The book begins with a preface which I found nice instead of the usual acknowledgements. The preface mentions the previous editions and why it has been updated. The book is rich of image examples and has in total 13 chapters that are grouped in the following sections:</p>
<ol><li>GUIDING PRINCIPLES</li>
<li>THINGS YOU NEED TO GET RIGHT</li>
<li>MAKING SURE YOU GOT THEM RIGHT</li>
<li>LARGER CONCERNS AND OUTSIDE INFLUENCES</li>
</ol><h3>Chapters 1-5 Guiding principles</h3>
<p>I liked the examples on how text should be used for headings, bullets and paragraphs. Most of the chapters in Guiding principles were boring. Some of the things mentioned in those chapters seemd like common sense and were mostly repetition. I agree with the author on those chapters and think most web designers should strive to follow his principles.</p>
<h3>Chapters 6-7 Things you need to get right</h3>
<p>This section focuses on the site navigation. It also covers the site elements like site id, navigations sections, search and page names.</p>
<h3>Chapters 8-9 Making sure you got them right</h3>
<p>I liked most of this section for all the usabillity testing ideas from the author. Some of the ways are expensive, but the author does present a cheaper DIY solution.</p>
<h3>Chapters 10-13 larger concerns and outside influences</h3>
<p>The most interesting part about this section is the mobile and accesibility chapters. I have to admit I know very little about accesibility in software development and found the chapter on it very enlightning. I enjoyed this section the most.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The book was good and I would definetly recommend it to others who care about the user experience in software development even though the book does have a lot of webpage examples. Of course some of the laws might not apply to every website or application but I do think they are good general rules to follow.</p>
