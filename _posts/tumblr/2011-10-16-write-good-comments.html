<p><style type="text/css"> <!--   @page { margin: 2cm }   P { margin-bottom: 0.21cm }  -->  </style><br/></p><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">I have spent much time reading on a coding style book¹. <br/>One thing that I noticed is that I  really write to much comments. Really unnecessary comments. The comments that I wrote documented simple functions where you could easily understand from the name why the function exists and what it does. I want fewer and simpler comments, that tell you what you need to know, but if you want more look at the implementation. I think it is important to keep as little comments as necessary from the implementation as possible. Since it could change drastically and possible often. Keeping it in the header gives you a nice overview. Bad commenting can cause odd bugs. I remember once writing <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% rgb(255, 255, 255);">bool</span>x does this in a comment. After revisiting the part of the code for an update. I read the comment and believed it since I  had written it. After changing some portion of the code and rerunning the application, I got a behavior that wasn&#8217;t expected. I searched the code and used the debugger and my print&#8217;s. When I found out which part of the code caused the issue. I realized two things were wrong with the Boolean, one it had the wrong name and two the comments were invalid. A new name, which made me use it the right way and removing the ugly comment fixed the bug.<br/><br/>Since most of my time has gone into <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% rgb(255, 255, 255);">refactoring</span> a current project, I plan on using more of the simple comments solution. It looks nicer and causes less bugs.</div><br/><span style="font-size: small;"><span id="btAsinTitle"></span></span><br/><a href="http://www.amazon.de/Code-Craft-Practice-Writing-Excellent/dp/1593271190"><span style="font-size: small;"><span id="btAsinTitle">¹Code Craft: The Practice of Writing Excellent Code </span></span></a>
