<p>Before starting on a project it is wise to have a specification, unless it is a tiny/familiar functionality. When the feature&#8217;s are documented time to build. The danger with not deciding beforehand what needs to be done, can cause many headaches, especially changes made throughout the project.<br/><br/>In a Project I have been working on now for 3 months, I made the specification and followed it as the bible. Of course there came a time where it had to be upgraded to the new testament, but It mostly stayed true to the orginal version. When the project neared the end, a new feature was requested. The new feature wasn&#8217;t big or hard to code, but what I had not considered, there were several source files that I hadn&#8217;t looked at in weeks. The changes I had to make for the feature caused a lot of the code to break, and inflicted a lot of time loss in finding numerous bugs. The big issue wasn&#8217;t that the code broke or the feature, but changing something when you have little time. <br/><br/>Note to self(Don&#8217;t make changes at the end), if you have to make a checklist first:<br/></p><ul><li>Good look at the source code.</li><li>Consider and evaluate how it affects the existing code.</li><li>See if you have enough time to make the changes.</li></ul>
