title: "How to improve my work?"
summary:
---

I recently asked myself how I could improve my work.  The question was sparked
while reading the introductory in pragmatic programmers by Ward Cunningham.
Hope I got his name right :p While thinking about it I came up with some things:

> Stop writing bugs is the most effetive one.

I produce bugs and they cost time. If I would reduce the amount of bugs I
produce my productivity would increase a lot. Most of my time is either spent on
writing new code or fixing bugs in existing projects.

> Ask better questions!

I think asking questions might help me improve my work by finding new process to
use.

> Listen when people talk

It is so easy to start daydreaming when someone is talking. I think paying
attention might improve the questions one asks and might decrease the number of
bugs introduced base on misunderstandings.

I hope these thoughts reappear next time I need them :smile:
